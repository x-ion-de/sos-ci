sos-ci - Simple OpenStack Continuous Integration
================================================

This is a somewhat simple app to let you implement a third-party CI
setup for OpenStack in your own lab.  

The great thing is there's a number of folks using this now, and some
have even contributed back.  The BAD thing is that there are a number
of people that are running this now and apparently know just next to
nothing about OpenStack.

Please, make sure you understand how tools like devstack and logging
in to OpenStack Instances works before trying this.  It would also
be VERY helpful to cruise on out to the your Internet Search Engine of
choice and read a bit about Ansible as well.

I recommend http://www.google.com for a lot of things.

For those that are interested in Containers, there's now a Dockerfile (build file)
included in this repo.  Additionaly you can always just download the image from
Docker-Hub at jgriffith/sos-ci.

The Container piece is *new* so there's surely room for improvement (including splitting up
services).  If there's interest it would be great to see that take off so that 3'rd party CI
is as simple as "docker run -t -i jgriffith/sos-ci /bin/bash".  Well, almost, need some things
to make auto-launch and respawn of the sos-ci process run automatically etc.

Requirements
------------
Current requirements and assumptions.

- You have to have an OpenStack Third Party CI account to monitor the Gerrit Stream
- All of this work thus far assumes running on an OpenStack Cloud
- Update/Modify sos-ci/ansible/vars.yml for your OpenStack creds
- If you want to do multi-nic (ie: seperate network for iSCSI, use multi-nic options)
- In order to use the mail notification option, install:
  * postfix
  * sendmail
- Make sure you have the system you're running all of this on set up such that
  you can log on to your instances with SSH. Personally I set up my systems
  with a .ssh/config file that includes my OpenStack IP ranges and the key
  associated with them, but of course use whatever method you like.
- mysql db
  Added support for subunit2sql, so we can take subunit results and keep a local
  DB of what we've run.  You'll need to setup/configure a MySQL database and populate
  the schema prior to use.  This is great for collection stats like how many tests
  we've run, pass/fail rate, timings etc etc.  Eventually we'll use this to push up
  to a dashboard.

  Can be enabled/disabled via conf file.  For more info on subunit2sql check here for
  instructions and more info:
    http://docs.openstack.org/developer/subunit2sql/

Requirements
------------
Packages installed via apt-get:
 vim
 git
 python-software-properties
 python-pip
 ruby
 lvm2
 python-dev
 python-novaclient
 postfix
 mysql-server
 libmysqlclient-dev


Additional setup
----------------
Whether running the Container image or buidling on a VM etc, there's a few things
you'll need to do.  Note that these things can/should be automated, particularly 
in the Dockerfile (if you're building it yourself):

* Set up your OpenStack creds file
* Source the creds file in your .bash_profile
* Configure the settings in sos-ci.conf
* Make sure you setup the default /etc/ansible/hosts and ansible.cfg files

Current Status
--------------
Updated May 27, 2015
* Added Dockerfile so you can build this as a container if you like
* Pushed a Docker image to Docker-Hub (jgriffith/sos-ci)

Update Mar 12, 2015
* Cleaned up the ansible config pieces a good bit
* Improved the logging
* Added hooks to create a DB and keep track of results/stats
* Remove hard coded variables that refer to my system and account

Update Dec 22, 2014
* Been running this for a few months now, pretty reliably
* Only issues I've encountered are cleanup issues from Tempest
  after busy weeks I can get to a point where I have over 5K accounts
  and several thousand volumes, rather than messing with trying to detect
  the state in ansible and cleanup during idle period, I just wrote a
  cron job to do this for me each day.

Still very much a work in progress.  Where it stands as of Aug 25, 17:50 UTC
* Source your OpenStack creds file
* Make sure default image-id, flavor, key-name etc are good, or specify in a creds file (to be added)
* Launch with two listener threads
* Picks events off of gerrit listener, and puts them in a queue
* Currently queue processor just launches an instance, sleeps 60 seconds and deletes instance
* Grabs next event in queue

TODO
-----
From a Container perspective it would be really good to break some
things out a bit.  The obvious would be the sql database (run in an 
independent container).  Could also use some more automation and
another run through on the config setup.

This is almost at a stage where you can download the container from Docker-Hub,
make some minor adjustments to the config and setttings and fire it off and never
have to worry about it.

Also there's a ton of low hanging fruit here in terms of optimizations and
cleanup, but the whole point of this effort was to setup a CI automation system
with little overhead and a fire and forget type of reliability... that's done so
I may or may not come back to it.

Highlights
----------
Some highlighted points, and maybe answers to some questions.

- Should work in any environment with just the addition of your own custom RC files
- Pretty much just raw Python code just like kiss
- Unlike kiss however we add a threaded job processor (my answer to node-pool, kinda)
- Allow pluggable pieces for instance deployment and devstack/tempest run
  Idea here is if you use Vagrant for deployment... cool, if you use Salt... cool
  Use what you like and what you have, but you can always just use good old simple
  python with ssh.

Questions
---------

Q: SSH checks to Instances fail, how come?
A: Ansible uses SSH to connect to hosts, you need to make sure you have your system
   setup to use ssh keys appropriately. For me I use my .ssh/config file for this,
   you may have other methods you prefer, but for me I just have a config entry
   that specifies my keypair for any IP in the range of OpenStack cloud.
